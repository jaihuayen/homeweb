Work experience
======
* Feb 2022 - Now: AI Software Engineer @QNAP
  * Trained an ResNet50 image classification model with an F1-Score of around 70% across 250 image classes and PaddleOCR OCR models to support languages not covered by PaddlePaddle, enhancing the efficiency of customers in swiftly searching for their photos.
  * Integrated a semantic search feature into our search engine, utilizing CLIP, to empower customers in effortlessly finding their photos and files through human-readable descriptions instead of conventional keyword searches.
  * Deployed models on edge devices such as Tensor Processing Unit and Neural Processing Unit to not only ensure the security of customer data but also enhance the speed of inference with limited computing resources.
  * Mentored a junior engineer and an intern on Python programming, project organization, and training OCR models.

* May 2020 - Feb 2022: AI Algorithm Engineer @TutorABC
  * Created an 81% accurate customer churn detection model using random forest to decrease refund rates through individual analysis of refund reasons using SHAP value.
  * Developed a customer purchase detection model utilizing random forest with a 78% accuracy rate to boost purchase rates by individually analyzing the predominant reasons for purchases using SHAP value in order to formulate targeted sales strategies.
  * Accelerated the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes by 50% and consolidated these processes through the implementation of Airflow for Machine Learning Operations (MLOps).
  * Provided guidance to a junior engineer in Python and SQL programming, project structuring, and Machine Learning Operations (MLOps).
