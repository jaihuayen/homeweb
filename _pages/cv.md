Education
======
* M.S. in Agronomy (Division of Biometry), National Taiwan University, 2017-2019
  * Advisor: [Chun-Huo Chiu](https://scholars.lib.ntu.edu.tw/cris/rp/rp08410/information.html)
  * Thesis: Richness Estimation with the Presence of Species Identity Error
* B.S. in Quantitative Finance, National Tsing Hua University, 2013-2017

Work experience
======
* Feb 2022 - Now: AI Software Engineer @QNAP
  * Trained an ResNet50 image classification model with an F1-Score of around 70% across 250 image classes and PaddleOCR OCR models to support languages not covered by PaddlePaddle, enhancing the efficiency of customers in swiftly searching for their photos.
  * Empowered customers by integrating a semantic search feature using CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training), a multimodal model, into the NAS search engine for photos and files, enabling efficient file searching through human-readable descriptions instead of conventional keyword searches.
  * Deployed models on edge devices such as Tensor Processing Unit and Neural Processing Unit to not only ensure the security of customer data but also enhance the speed of inference with limited computing resources.
  * Mentored a junior engineer and an intern on Python programming, project organization, and training OCR models.

* May 2020 - Feb 2022: AI Algorithm Engineer @TutorABC
  * Created an 81% accurate customer churn detection model using random forest and used an explainable machine learning method (SHAP value) to decrease churn rates.
  * Developed a customer purchase detection model using XGBoost with a 78% accuracy rate and utilized SHAP value to boost purchase rates and formulate future targeted sales strategies.
Conduct statistical analysis reports using experimental design and survival analysis to provide business insights and decisions for different marketing strategies.
  * Accelerated the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes by 50% and consolidated these processes through the implementation of Airflow for Machine Learning Operations (MLOps).
  * Provided guidance to a junior engineer in Python and SQL programming, project structuring, and Machine Learning Operations (MLOps).
