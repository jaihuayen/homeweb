Education
======
* M.S. in Agronomy (Division of Biometry), National Taiwan University, 2017-2019
  * Advisor: [Chun-Huo Chiu](https://scholars.lib.ntu.edu.tw/cris/rp/rp08410/information.html)
  * Thesis: Richness Estimation with the Presence of Species Identity Error
* B.S. in Quantitative Finance, National Tsing Hua University, 2013-2017


Work experience
======
* Feb 2022 - Now: AI Software Engineer @QNAP
  * Created an 81% accurate customer churn detection model using random forest to decrease refund rates through individual analysis of refund reasons using SHAP value.
  * Developed a customer purchase detection model utilizing random forest with a 78% accuracy rate to boost purchase rates by individually analyzing the predominant reasons for purchases using SHAP value in order to formulate targeted sales strategies.
  * Accelerated the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes by 50% and consolidated these processes through the implementation of Airflow for Machine Learning Operations (MLOps).
  * Provided guidance to a junior engineer in Python and SQL programming, project structuring, and Machine Learning Operations (MLOps).

* May 2020 - Feb 2022: AI Algorithm Engineer @TutorABC
  * Derive a non-parametric species richness estimator that reduces underestimation by approximately 15% in observed species richness and addresses a 10% overestimation in scenarios with very low corrected denominators, all while mitigating identity errors often encountered in species surveys.
  * Conduct data cleaning on weed and plant cover species surveys conducted in Soft Bridge County, Taiwan, and Grand St. Bernard Pass, Switzerland.
