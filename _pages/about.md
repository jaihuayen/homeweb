I am currently an AI Software Engineer in [QNAP](https://www.qnap.com/en). My work recently focus on training computer vision (image classification, OCR) models, deployment of model on edge AI runtimes (ONNXRuntime, OpenVINO, RKNPU, Coral Edge TPU), and optimization and deployment of zero-shot language-image model (MCLIP) in [QuMagie](https://www.qnap.com/en-us/software/qumagie) and [QSirch](https://www.qnap.com/en-us/software/qsirch). Prior to this position, I was an AI Algorithm Engineer in [TutorABC](https://www.tutorabc.com/site/en_us). I worked on data analysis in customer and product data. Also, I applied nature language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) to consumer’s response, company products, and company services so as to improve user experience and increase company’s revenue. Moreover, I started to implement Docker, Airflow ETL process, and CI/CD process to realize MLOps in AI team.
