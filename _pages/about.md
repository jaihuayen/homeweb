Hi I am Jaihua! You can call me Kevin if you are not used to speak Chinese name.

Currently, I serve as an AI Software Engineer at [QNAP](https://www.qnap.com/en), where my primary focus lies in training computer vision models for tasks like image classification and OCR. My responsibilities extend to deploying these models on edge AI runtimes such as ONNXRuntime, OpenVINO, RKNPU, and Coral Edge TPU. Additionally, I contribute to the optimization and deployment of zero-shot language-image models like MCLIP in [QuMagie](https://www.qnap.com/en-us/software/qumagie) and [QSirch](https://www.qnap.com/en-us/software/qsirch).

In my previous role as an AI Algorithm Engineer at [TutorABC](https://www.tutorabc.com/site/en_us), I specialized in data analysis of customer and product data. I applied natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) techniques to analyze consumer responses, company products, and services. The goal was to enhance user experience and boost company revenue. Furthermore, I played a key role in implementing Docker, Airflow ETL processes, and CI/CD processes to establish MLOps within the AI team.
